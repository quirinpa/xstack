# xstack
*xstack* was made for the purpose of pushing/popping windows to/from an invisible stack. It is composed of two tools: one exposes a tcp server socket and connects to an xdisplay, the other sends push and pop commands to it.

## IT IS JUST AN EXPERIMENT
Please dont take it very seriously. It is mostly a way for me to learn linux socket programming and other stuff.

## Suggestions are welcome
Feel free to contact me through the normal means.
